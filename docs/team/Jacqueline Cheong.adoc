== PROJECT: Medeina

---

== Overview

Medeina is a desktop application designed for veterinarians and their assistants to better manage their contacts, pet patient details and appointments. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Autocomplete
** What it does: Provide autocomplete suggestions that come with descriptions to give users an idea of what the option or prefix is used for. Users are also given information such as existing Nric in Medeina and pet patient names as autocomplete suggestions for certain commands.
** Justification: Medeina's command syntax involves many options and parameters, which makes it difficult for users to remember. The difficulty in recalling would cause inefficiency in the usage of Medeina. Users of Medeina are expected to handle sensitive information that has little room for errors. By providing autocomplete function for existing data in Medeina, the room for error can be greatly reduced.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires the exploration of singleton pattern in design and listeners for JavaFX. It involves an in-depth analysis of command syntax and user-input, and in the process, discovered that JavaFX's textfield caret position is not updated in sync with textfield's content.
** Credits: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8088614[Bug fix for the above mentioned issue]

* *Minor enhancement*: Support for changing theme that is persistent beyond app restart.
