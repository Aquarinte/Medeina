== Overview

AddressBook - Level 4 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to delete and force delete*
** What it does: deletion can be done by including a option together with the index of what is to be deleted. Force deletion can be done for owner and pet patient options, where all relevant dependencies are also deleted together with the index of what needs to be deleted.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can delete other information other than persons, like pet patients and appointments. In addition, the user does not need to go through the hassle of deleting every dependency (appointments, pet patients) before an owner can be deleted, but can just use the force option to immediately delete all dependencies.
** Highlights: This enhancement changes the format of the delete command to `delete -OPTION INDEX`. Implementation for the force option was difficult as it required safe deletion of dependencies before an element that has dependencies can be deleted.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability find owners, pet patients and multiple prefixes of information*
** What it does: find can be done by including an `OPTION` (accepted `-o` for owner, `-p` for pet patients) and added with any amount of supported `PREFIX` with any amount of keywords under each `PREFIX`.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can find all important information, not only just by name, which was in the initial implementation of the find command. In addition, the user can find more specific information by adding on prefixes and more keywords. This is important especially for pet patients, when they need to find for specific pets for instance, a cat with blood type A that can be a blood donor to a dying patient.
** Highlights: This enhancement changes the format of the find command to `delete -OPTION PREFIX/KEYWORDS [MORE_PREFIX/MORE_KEYWORDS]`. The find command can go as specific as `find -p n/NAME s/SPECIES b/BREED c/COLOUR bt/BLOOD_TYPE t/TAGS` to find as specific information as possible. This required understanding of the prior FindCommand which made heavy use of Java 8 Predicates.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the capability to store appointments in the .xml file.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the capability list appointments of any date, in all 4 views allowed in CalendarFX.
