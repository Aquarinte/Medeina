== Introduction

Are you a veterinarian or a veterinary assistant in need of help to manage growing number of contacts, never-ending list of pet patients and floods of appointments? Are you having nightmares over the sheer amount of data to catalogue? Are you struggling to find the right pet patient's details and owner's contact amongst a plethora of paper records for each of your appointment?

Medeina is finally here to solve your problems.

=== What is Medeina

Medeina is a specialized desktop application designed to provide veterinarians and their assistants with better management over contacts, pet patient details and appointments. It serves as both an address book and a task manager.

If you are comfortable working with a Command Line Interface (CLI), then Medeina is perfect for you. Nevertheless, Medeina keeps to simple and intuitive commands that even those who are unfamiliar with CLI can pick it up easily. Medeina also comes with a clean and organized Graphical User Interface (GUI) to present information in the most optimal way for your perusal.

Medeina, your all-in-one solution to curb the data nightmare.

=== Using this Guide

This document provides detailed information pertaining to Medeina's set-up and usage instructions for the various features it offers. The user guide can be accessed any time through the `help` command in Medeina.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command format used in Medeina :*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add **-o** n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add **-o** n/John Doe`.
* Characters in **bold** are options to be specified by the user to execute variants of a command e.g. in `add **-p** n/NAME`, **-p** denotes to add a pet patient.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Shorthand equivalent alias is available for all commands to simplify execution of commands e.g. `a` is the alias for `add`.
====
====
*Command autocomplete in Medeina :* `[Since v1.3]`

image::autocomplete.png[width="500"]

* Medeina supports autocomplete for command words, options, prefixes, NRICs, pet patient names and tags.
* You will be shown a list of suggested NRICs when when you need to reference an existing person in Medeina e.g. adding a pet patient / appointment, editing a pet patient to change ownership.
* You will also be shown a list of suggested pet patients names when you need to reference them in `*-p* n/PET_PATIENT_NAME`.
* Autocomplete matching is case-insensitive e.g. you will see autocomplete suggestions 'edit' and 'exit' when you type 'E'.
* You can use kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down], or kbd:[Tab] to traverse through the autocomplete suggestions in the pop-up context menu.
* Press kbd:[Enter] to select an autocomplete suggestion on the pop-up context menu.
